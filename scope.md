## 3. Misc

"Accountability Posting"
- The practice where people make commitments to share their progress publicly online, commonly on social platforms like twitter or personal blog sites
- Ex: The artist "Beeple" posted their artwork to their site at https://www.beeple-crap.com/everydays everyday for 1000s of days
- The idea is that posting your goals and progress publicly will motivate you to continue to keep your streak going and to not disappoint people

"Card Collecting & Battle System"
- "Cards" will just be random internet memes, pictures, etc that will be assigned some stats and effects and will be displayed in a "card format"
- The idea is to give users something to spend their "points" on so that they are incentivized to do more accountability posting to get more "points"
- The idea behind the "battle system" would be to emulate some popular existing card game like "Hearthstone" or "Gwent" to make collecting and using cards, "fun"
- Also have an idea to include some sort of PVE feature to have users be able to work together to defeat "enemies" with cards, akin to "5 min Dungeon" game

"Tools and Services"
- On top of all the fun features like points, shops, cards, etc., the applications in this project should provide basic tools and services to make accountability posting easy and convenient
  - Such as allowing users to view, set, and modify their accountability tasks
- Maybe include some functionality to send users warnings if they miss too many days from accountability posting
